# Pepper-s-Ghost----spinning-Earth
This repo tells all the software details about how to create an illusion of a spinning Earth

The demo can be viewed at https://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNDE5NjgzNDk2MA==.html?spm=a2h0j.11185381.listitem_page1.5!2~A

Hardware Design:
You need to Prepare 4 thin Arcrylic Boards(1mm thick) and cut them into 4 identical pieces:

Glue the 4 pieces to form a funnel:

Software design:
Imagine you have a mirror horizontally placed, facing downwards. A globe is placed under the mirror. So its image will be above the mirror.

But we don't have this globe under the mirror, so how can one still get an image? This can be done in 2 steps:
1) replace the mirror by a flat computer monitor;
2) place the funnel on the top of the monitor
